Interactive Web-Based Application: ABC Restaurant

The source code for the web-based ABC Restaurant application, a dependable and expandable solution created for a well-known restaurant chain with several locations around Sri Lanka, is available in this repository. The program uses database-driven design and contemporary web technologies to improve the dining establishment's internal processes and customer experience. The program ensures easy operation for both staff and clients with features including online reservations, query submissions, searches for hospitality services, and more.

The ABC Restaurant system was created in response to the restaurant's board of directors' wish to integrate technological improvements into their operations. This interactive web-based platform functions as an online portal, allowing consumers to effortlessly make reservations, inquire about services, and explore the restaurant's offers through a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The system also enables restaurant employees to manage reservations, handle customer inquiries, and collect payments.

The system contains three unique user roles: Administrator, Restaurant Staff, and Customers, each with varying access rights to ensure that the functionality accessible to each user is appropriate for their role.

Key features include

	Online Reservation System: Customers can use the program to make reservations for dine-in or delivery. Customers simply enter the date, time, and number of visitors, and the system will automatically confirm availability and generate a reservation ID. Staff may see and manage reservations using a protected dashboard.

	User Management: The system uses role-based access control. Admin users have full control over services, staff, and reservations. Restaurant workers may view, manage, and respond to customer reservations and inquiries. Customers can create accounts, make reservations, and send inquiries.



	Query Submission: Customers can submit questions about restaurant services, menu items, and other features of the establishment. These inquiries are recorded in the system, and restaurant employees can answer via their dashboard, simplifying communication between consumers and the restaurant.

	Search Facilities: The system features extensive search capability that allows users to find available services, view current specials, and compare rates for various providers. This feature enhances the entire user experience by allowing customers to find what they need fast and conveniently.

	Admin Reports: Admin users can create useful reports that provide insights into restaurant operations, such as monthly revenue reports, reservation data, client inquiries, and service utilization statistics. These reports assist restaurant management in making data-driven decisions that increase operational efficiency.

	The platform was built to provide a smooth and interactive user experience. The user interfaces are designed to be visually appealing and intuitive, allowing customers to easily browse through the application, search for services, and make reservations. Restaurant employees and administrators have access to simple dashboards that help them manage their jobs effectively.


The technologies used

	Backend: Apache Tomcat 9 hosts the system's Java-powered backend. All business logic, such as role-based access control, reservations, user authentication, and query submissions, is managed by the backend.

	Database: MySQL Workbench is used by the system to manage databases. Information about users, reservations, queries, services, and reports is kept in the database. Dependability and consistency of data are guaranteed by the relational database paradigm.

	Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used in the construction of the system's frontend. Rather of relying on frameworks like Bootstrap, the design adopts a simple and contemporary approach and employs bespoke CSS styling. This guarantees that the user interface will always be highly configurable and light.

	Development Environment: The Eclipse IDE, a potent tool that facilitates effective Java web development, was used to construct the project. The application server, Apache Tomcat 9, manages the Java servlet and JSP execution.
